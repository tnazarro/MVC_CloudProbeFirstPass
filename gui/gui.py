"""
Pseudocode for a GUI application using Tkinter:

1. Import necessary libraries:
   - tkinter for GUI components
    - matplotlib for plotting
    - seaborn for advanced plotting
    - pandas for data manipulation

2. Define the main application class:
   - Initialize the main window
    - Set the title and size of the window
    - Create a menu bar with options for file operations, settings, and help

3. Create a method to load data files:
   - Use a file dialog to select files
   - Read the selected files into a pandas DataFrame
    - Update the GUI with the loaded data
4. Create methods for plotting data:
   - Define methods for different types of plots (e.g., time series, scatter plots)
5. Create a method to handle user interactions:
   - Bind buttons and menu options to their respective methods  
6. Create a method to update the GUI based on user input:
   - Refresh the displayed data and plots when the user makes changes   
7. Define a method to show help information:
   - Display a message box with instructions or information about the application
# This is a placeholder for the GUI code that would be implemented in the future.
# The actual implementation will depend on the specific requirements and design of the application.
